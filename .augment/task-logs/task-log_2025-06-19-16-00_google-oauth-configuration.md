# Task Log: Google OAuth Configuration for PantryPal AI

## Task Information
- **Date**: 2025-06-19
- **Time Started**: 16:00
- **Time Completed**: 16:30
- **Files Modified**: .env.local (OAuth credentials)

## Task Details
- **Goal**: Configure Google OAuth authentication for PantryPal AI to enable users to sign in with their Google accounts
- **Implementation**: 
  - Guided user through Google Cloud Console OAuth client creation
  - Configured OAuth consent screen with External audience type
  - Created "PantryPal AI Web Client" OAuth application
  - Added Google OAuth credentials to .env.local file
  - Configured Supabase Google provider with Client ID and Client Secret
  - Set up proper redirect URIs in both Google Console and Supabase
  - Configured Site URL in Supabase to production domain
- **Challenges**: 
  - Initial redirect URI misconfiguration causing localhost redirects from production
  - User needed guidance on Google Cloud Console navigation
  - Supabase MCP tools don't support OAuth provider configuration (manual dashboard setup required)
- **Decisions**: 
  - Used External OAuth audience type for public accessibility
  - Configured multiple redirect URIs for both development and production environments
  - Set production Site URL to https://www.pantrypal-ai.space

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 22/23
- **Strengths**: 
  - Successfully guided user through complete OAuth setup process
  - Identified and resolved redirect URI configuration issues
  - Provided clear step-by-step instructions for both Google Console and Supabase
  - Properly configured both development and production environments
  - Used appropriate tools (Supabase MCP for project identification)
- **Areas for Improvement**: 
  - Could have initially mentioned that Supabase MCP doesn't support OAuth configuration (-1 point)

## OAuth Configuration Details
- **Google OAuth Client**: PantryPal AI Web Client
- **Client ID**: 575781291415-6f282io31fcf9er9hqdjgghI5mnej033.apps.googleusercontent.com
- **Authorized JavaScript Origins**:
  - http://localhost:3000
  - https://www.pantrypal-ai.space
- **Authorized Redirect URIs**:
  - http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
  - https://www.pantrypal-ai.space/auth/callback
  - https://qwuswfheajgdozydnzfc.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
- **Supabase Site URL**: https://www.pantrypal-ai.space

## Next Steps
- Test Google OAuth functionality on both development and production environments
- Monitor authentication logs for any issues
- Consider implementing additional OAuth providers if needed (GitHub, Facebook, etc.)
- Document OAuth setup process for future reference

## Additional Documentation Created
- **Cooking Level System Documentation**: Created comprehensive technical documentation for the cooking level functionality at `docs/technical/cooking-level-system-documentation.md`
- **Documentation Scope**: Covers system architecture, technical implementation, database schema, UI components, and future enhancements
- **User Request**: Fulfilled user's request to document the cooking level system with suitable naming and detailed explanation

## Technical Notes
- OAuth consent screen configured as External type for public access
- Testing mode is sufficient for production use (no verification required)
- Supabase automatically handles OAuth token management and user creation
- Environment variables properly secured in .env.local file
