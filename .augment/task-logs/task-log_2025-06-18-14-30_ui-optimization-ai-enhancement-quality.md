## Task Information
- **Date**: 2025-06-18
- **Time Started**: 14:30
- **Time Completed**: 15:45
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`
  - `src/app/api/deepseek/enhance/route.ts`
  - `src/components/ui/RecipeEnhancement.tsx`
  - `src/components/ui/EnhancementComparison.tsx`

## Task Details

### Goal
1. Remove Instagram and Twitter icons from footer as per user preference
2. Enhance AI enhancement output quality by removing introductory sentences like "Here are the enhancements..."

### Implementation

#### 1. Social Media Icons Removal
**Problem**: Footer contained Instagram and Twitter icons that user wanted removed
**Solution**: 
- Located Footer component (`src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`)
- Removed Instagram and Twitter icon elements from social media section
- Kept Facebook and GitHub icons for essential social presence
- Maintained clean, professional footer appearance

**Code Changes**:
- Removed Instagram `<a>` element with SVG icon (lines 43-48)
- Removed Twitter `<a>` element with SVG icon (lines 49-54)
- Preserved Facebook and GitHub icons for minimal social media presence

#### 2. AI Enhancement Output Quality Optimization
**Problem**: AI-generated enhancements included introductory sentences like "Here are 3-5 specific enhancements for each category..." which cluttered the user experience

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive filtering across multiple components

**A. DeepSeek API Route Enhancement** (`src/app/api/deepseek/enhance/route.ts`):
- **Enhanced System Prompt**: Added explicit instructions to NOT include introductory sentences
- **Improved Response Filtering**: Advanced parsing logic to:
  - Skip lines starting with common introductory phrases
  - Filter out sentences containing "enhancements for", "suggestions for"
  - Remove embedded introductory phrases
  - Filter out very short lines (less than 10 characters)

**B. RecipeEnhancement Component** (`src/components/ui/RecipeEnhancement.tsx`):
- **Comprehensive Text Cleaning**: Added multiple regex patterns to remove:
  - "Here are...", "Here is...", "Below are...", "I suggest..."
  - Sentences containing "enhancements for", "suggestions for"
  - Bullet points and formatting markers
  - Very short enhancements (less than 10 characters)

**C. EnhancementComparison Component** (`src/components/ui/EnhancementComparison.tsx`):
- **Added Cleaning Logic**: Applied same comprehensive cleaning to comparison display
- **Professional Display**: AI vs Human comparison now shows clean, direct suggestions
- **Consistent Quality**: Eliminated introductory text from comparison interface

### Challenges
1. **Multiple Component Integration**: Had to apply cleaning logic across several components to ensure consistency
2. **Regex Pattern Matching**: Required comprehensive patterns to catch various introductory phrase formats
3. **Maintaining Content Quality**: Ensured cleaning didn't remove valuable enhancement content

### Decisions
1. **Comprehensive Approach**: Applied cleaning logic at multiple levels (API, component, display) for redundancy
2. **User Experience Focus**: Prioritized clean, direct enhancement content over verbose AI responses
3. **Professional Presentation**: Maintained consistent quality across all AI enhancement displays
