   - Reduced internal padding while preserving visual hierarchy

3. **Form Element Spacing**:
   - Reduced form spacing from `space-y-4` to `space-y-2`
   - Maintained adequate separation between form fields

4. **Input Field Optimization**:
   - Decreased all input field heights from `h-10` to `h-9`
   - Applied to email, password, and confirm password fields
   - Preserved icon positioning and visual consistency

5. **Button Optimization**:
