## Task Information
- **Date**: 2025-06-15
- **Time Started**: 16:00
- **Time Completed**: 16:30
- **Files Modified**: src/app/globals.css

## Task Details

### Goal
Fix Recipe Summary text alignment on mobile devices to ensure justified text formatting and develop strategic plan for next development phase.

### Implementation

#### 1. Mobile Text Justification Fix
**Issue Identified:**
- Recipe Summary text was displaying with left alignment on mobile devices
- CSS media query for mobile had `text-align: left` instead of `justify`
- Inconsistent text formatting between desktop and mobile

**Solution Implemented:**
- Updated mobile CSS media query in `src/app/globals.css`
- Changed `text-align` from `left` to `justify` for mobile screens
- Added `text-justify: inter-word` for better word spacing
- Added `hyphens: auto` for proper word breaking on mobile
- Maintained responsive font sizing and line height

**Technical Changes:**
```css
/* Before */
@media (max-width: 640px) {
  .recipe-summary {
    font-size: 0.9rem;
    line-height: 1.6;
    text-align: left;  /* ❌ Left aligned */
  }
}

/* After */
@media (max-width: 640px) {
  .recipe-summary {
    font-size: 0.9rem;
    line-height: 1.6;
    text-align: justify;        /* ✅ Justified */
    text-justify: inter-word;   /* ✅ Better spacing */
    hyphens: auto;             /* ✅ Word breaking */
  }
}
```
