- Use external project management tools only
- Rely on Git history for project context

## Consequences
- **Accepted**: Memory Bank provides persistent context across sessions
- **Accepted**: Structured workflow improves development quality
- **Accepted**: Documentation overhead balanced by improved efficiency
- **Accepted**: Self-evaluation system ensures high standards

## Status
**Active** - Memory Bank initialized, ready for systematic development

## Immediate Context

### Just Completed
1. **Complete Validation System Removal**
   - Removed all validation database tables (`academic_validations`, `enhancement_validations`, `enhancement_comparisons`, `user_evaluations`)
   - Deleted all validation API clients (`academicValidationApi.ts`, `validationApi.ts`, `userEvaluationApi.ts`)
   - Removed all validation UI components (`AcademicValidationResults.tsx`, `ValidationResultsDisplay.tsx`)
   - Cleaned up all validation integration from recipe page
   - Removed all validation API routes and validator scripts
   - Removed entire `scripts/validation` directory and `src/app/api/validation` directory
   - Updated codebase to remove all validation system references

2. **Database Cleanup**
   - Used Supabase MCP tools to identify and remove all validation-related tables
   - Ensured no orphaned data or references remain
   - Verified database integrity after complete table removal

3. **Code Cleanup**
   - Removed all imports and references to validation systems
   - Cleaned up state management related to all validation features
   - Removed UI components and handlers for all validation systems
   - Updated Memory Bank documentation to reflect complete removal

### Current Understanding
- **Project State**: Core features implemented, academic validation feature removed as requested
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript + Supabase + Tailwind CSS
- **Key Features**: Recipe search, AI enhancement, user auth, recipe saving
- **Development Environment**: Node.js 23.9, npm, VS Code, Git
- **Recent Change**: All validation systems completely removed from codebase and database
- **Server Status**: Development server running successfully at http://localhost:3000

## Next Immediate Steps

### Priority 1: Core Feature Enhancement
1. **Recipe Search Optimization** - Improve search functionality and user experience
2. **AI Enhancement Quality** - Refine AI suggestion algorithms and presentation
3. **User Authentication** - Complete user auth flow and profile management
4. **Recipe Management** - Enhance recipe saving and organization features

### Priority 2: System Integration
1. **Supabase MCP Integration** - Use preferred Supabase MCP tools for database operations
2. **Performance Optimization** - Ensure fast response times for all features
3. **Mobile Responsiveness** - Verify all features work well on mobile devices
4. **Accessibility Improvements** - Enhance screen reader support across the application

### Priority 3: Documentation and Quality
1. **Update Technical Documentation** - Document academic validation system
2. **Create User Guide** - Instructions for using academic validation
3. **Quality Assurance Testing** - Comprehensive testing of all features
4. **Thesis Documentation** - Prepare academic validation documentation for examiner

## Current Work Focus

### Primary Objective
Establish a robust development foundation with comprehensive memory system to enable systematic, high-quality development of PantryPal AI features.

### Key Challenges
1. **Validation System Requirements**: User's examiner needs proof of AI validity through comparison with human-scraped data
2. **AI Enhancement Integration**: Core feature requiring careful implementation
3. **User Experience Optimization**: Balancing functionality with usability
4. **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring fast, responsive application

### Success Criteria
- Memory Bank system fully operational
- Clear development roadmap established
- Validation system requirements understood
- Next development phase planned and ready to execute

## Development Environment Status

### Tools and Setup
- ‚úÖ Node.js 23.9 installed and working
- ‚úÖ npm package manager operational
- ‚úÖ Git version control active
- ‚úÖ VS Code with TypeScript support
- ‚úÖ Project dependencies installed

### Environment Variables Needed
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY  
- NEXT_PUBLIC_RECIPE_API_KEY

### Current Codebase Status
- ‚úÖ Basic Next.js structure in place
- ‚úÖ UI components partially implemented
- ‚úÖ Supabase integration configured

## Memory Bank Maintenance

### Files Created This Session
1. `.augment/core/projectbrief.md` - Project overview and objectives
2. `.augment/core/productContext.md` - Market analysis and user needs
3. `.augment/core/systemPatterns.md` - Architecture patterns and decisions
4. `.augment/core/techContext.md` - Technology stack and infrastructure
5. `.augment/core/activeContext.md` - Current work state (this file)

### Next Memory Updates Needed
1. Create progress.md with implementation status
2. Create memory-index.md with file checksums
3. Initialize plans directory structure
4. Initialize task-logs directory structure
5. Initialize errors directory structure

## User Requirements Context

### Validation System Priority
- User's examiner requires validation system to prove AI suggestion correctness
- Must compare AI results with human-scraped data
- Focus on demonstrating AI validity, not just quality assessment
- Critical for project evaluation and success

### User Preferences
- Prefers using Supabase MCP tools for database operations
- Values systematic approach to development
- Requires high-quality, production-ready code
- Emphasizes proper documentation and testing

## Session Completion Criteria

### For This Session
- [x] Memory Bank structure created
- [x] Core memory files populated
- [x] Project context fully documented
- [ ] Complete memory system setup (progress.md, memory-index.md, etc.)
- [ ] Create initial development plan
- [ ] Document validation system requirements

### For Next Session
- Complete Memory Bank initialization
- Analyze current codebase in detail
