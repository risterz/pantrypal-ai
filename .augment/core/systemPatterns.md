# System Patterns: PantryPal AI

## Context
Architectural patterns and design decisions that guide the development of PantryPal AI's technical implementation.

## Decision
Adopt modern web application patterns with emphasis on scalability, maintainability, and user experience optimization.

## Alternatives
- Monolithic server-side application
- Microservices architecture
- Static site generation only
- Native mobile application

## Consequences
- **Accepted**: Next.js App Router provides excellent developer experience and performance
- **Accepted**: Supabase reduces backend complexity but creates vendor dependency
- **Accepted**: Component-based architecture enables reusability and maintainability
- **Accepted**: TypeScript adds development overhead but improves code quality

## Status
**Implemented** - Core patterns established and documented

## Architecture Overview

### Application Architecture Pattern
**Pattern**: Jamstack with Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)
- **Frontend**: Next.js with React (Static + SSR)
- **Backend**: Supabase (Database, Auth, Real-time)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (Edge functions, CDN)
- **External APIs**: Spoonacular (Recipe data)

### Benefits
- Excellent performance through edge deployment
- Simplified backend management
- Automatic scaling and optimization
- Strong developer experience

## Frontend Patterns

### Component Architecture
**Pattern**: Atomic Design with Feature-Based Organization

```
components/
├── ui/           # Atomic components (buttons, inputs)
├── layout/       # Layout components (header, footer)
├── pantry/       # Pantry feature components
├── recipes/      # Recipe feature components
└── forms/        # Form-specific components
```

### State Management Pattern
**Pattern**: React Server Components + Client State
- **Server State**: React Server Components for data fetching
- **Client State**: React hooks (useState, useReducer) for UI state
- **Form State**: React Hook Form for complex forms
- **Global State**: React Context for user session

### Data Fetching Pattern
**Pattern**: Server-First with Client Hydration
- Server Components fetch initial data
- Client Components handle interactions
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Error boundaries for graceful failures

## Backend Patterns

### Database Design Pattern
**Pattern**: Relational with JSON Extensions

```sql
-- Core entities with relationships
profiles (user data)
saved_recipes (user favorites)
saved_ingredients (user pantry)
dietary_preferences (filter options)

-- JSON fields for flexible data
recipe_data (cached API responses)
dietary_preferences (user selections)
search_query (complex search state)
```

### Authentication Pattern
**Pattern**: JWT with Row Level Security (RLS)
- Supabase Auth handles token management
- RLS policies enforce data access rules
- Client-side auth state management
- Automatic token refresh

### API Integration Pattern
**Pattern**: Server-Side Proxy with Caching
- Next.js API routes proxy external APIs
- Response caching for performance
- Error handling and retry logic
- Rate limiting protection

## UI/UX Patterns

### Design System Pattern
**Pattern**: Utility-First with Component Library
- Tailwind CSS for utility classes
- ShadCN UI for consistent components
- Custom design tokens for branding
- Responsive design patterns

### Navigation Pattern
**Pattern**: App Router with Nested Layouts
- File-based routing with Next.js App Router
- Nested layouts for consistent UI
- Loading and error states
- Progressive enhancement

### Form Handling Pattern
**Pattern**: Controlled Components with Validation
- React Hook Form for form state
- Zod schemas for validation
- Server-side validation backup
- Optimistic UI updates

## Performance Patterns

### Loading Strategy Pattern
**Pattern**: Progressive Loading with Suspense
- React Suspense for loading states
- Skeleton components for perceived performance
- Image optimization with Next.js Image
- Code splitting by route and feature

### Caching Strategy Pattern
**Pattern**: Multi-Layer Caching
- Browser cache for static assets
- Next.js cache for API responses
- Supabase cache for database queries
- CDN cache for global distribution

### Error Handling Pattern
**Pattern**: Graceful Degradation
- Error boundaries for component failures
- Fallback UI for network errors
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures
- User-friendly error messages

## Security Patterns

### Data Protection Pattern
**Pattern**: Defense in Depth
- Client-side input validation
- Server-side validation and sanitization
- Database constraints and RLS
- HTTPS everywhere

### Authentication Security Pattern
**Pattern**: Secure by Default
- Secure cookie settings
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- Password strength requirements

## Development Patterns

### Code Organization Pattern
**Pattern**: Feature-Based with Shared Utilities

```
src/
├── app/          # Next.js App Router pages
├── components/   # Reusable UI components
├── lib/          # Shared utilities and services
├── types/        # TypeScript type definitions
└── hooks/        # Custom React hooks
```

### Testing Pattern
**Pattern**: Testing Pyramid
- Unit tests for utilities and hooks
- Component tests for UI logic
- Integration tests for user flows
- E2E tests for critical paths

### Type Safety Pattern
**Pattern**: Strict TypeScript with Runtime Validation
- Strict TypeScript configuration
- Zod schemas for runtime validation
- Generated types from Supabase
- Type-safe API clients

## AI Integration Patterns

### AI Service Pattern
**Pattern**: Microservice with Fallbacks
- Dedicated AI service for enhancements
- Graceful degradation when AI unavailable
- Caching of AI responses
- User feedback loop for improvements

### Enhancement Delivery Pattern
**Pattern**: Progressive Enhancement
- Base recipe functionality works without AI
- AI suggestions enhance the experience
- User can accept/reject suggestions
- Learning from user interactions

## Monitoring and Observability Patterns

### Logging Pattern
**Pattern**: Structured Logging with Context
- Consistent log format across services
- Request correlation IDs
- User action tracking
- Performance metrics

### Error Tracking Pattern
**Pattern**: Centralized Error Management
- Client-side error reporting
- Server-side error logging
- User impact assessment
- Automated alerting

## Deployment Patterns

### CI/CD Pattern
**Pattern**: GitOps with Automated Testing
- Git-based deployment triggers
- Automated testing pipeline
- Preview deployments for PRs
- Production deployment gates

### Environment Management Pattern
**Pattern**: Environment Parity
- Consistent environments across dev/staging/prod
- Environment-specific configuration
- Secrets management
- Database migrations

## Scalability Patterns

### Horizontal Scaling Pattern
**Pattern**: Stateless Application Design
- Stateless server components
- Database connection pooling
- CDN for static asset delivery
- Auto-scaling based on demand

### Data Scaling Pattern
**Pattern**: Read Replicas with Caching
- Read replicas for query performance
- Application-level caching
- Database query optimization
- Pagination for large datasets

These patterns provide a solid foundation for building and maintaining PantryPal AI while ensuring scalability, maintainability, and excellent user experience.
