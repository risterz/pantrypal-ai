# PantryPal AI Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The PantryPal project is currently in the initialization phase. We have established the core project structure and defined the key requirements and architecture. The main focus areas are:

1. **Memory Bank Setup**
   - Creating the foundational documentation structure
   - Defining project requirements and architecture
   - Establishing technical context and workflows

2. **Project Planning**
   - Defining the implementation approach
   - Creating detailed task breakdown
   - Establishing development priorities

3. **Architecture Definition**
   - Finalizing the technical stack
   - Defining component relationships
   - Planning data flows and API integrations

## Recent Changes

- Initialized the Memory Bank structure with core files
- Created comprehensive project documentation
- Defined system architecture and patterns
- Documented technical context and dependencies

## Next Steps

1. **Development Environment Setup**
   - Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
   - Set up Supabase integration
   - Configure Tailwind CSS
   - Implement ESLint and Prettier

2. **Core Feature Implementation**
   - Develop recipe search functionality using Spoonacular API
   - Implement DeepSeek AI integration for recipe enhancements
   - Create user authentication with Supabase
   - Build responsive UI components

3. **Testing and Validation**
   - Implement unit and integration tests
   - Validate API integrations
   - Test user flows and experience
   - Ensure performance and accessibility standards

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **AI Enhancement Strategy**
   - Determining the optimal approach for combining AI-generated and human-curated enhancements
   - Balancing real-time generation with pre-computed suggestions
   - Defining enhancement categories and presentation

2. **Data Management**
   - Planning caching strategies for API responses
   - Defining database schema for user preferences and saved recipes
   - Establishing data synchronization patterns

3. **User Experience Flow**
   - Refining the recipe search and enhancement interaction
   - Optimizing the presentation of enhancement suggestions
   - Designing the user feedback mechanism for AI suggestions

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implementing efficient API request patterns
   - Planning for image optimization and lazy loading
   - Ensuring responsive performance across devices

This active context document will be regularly updated to reflect the current state of the project, recent changes, and upcoming priorities.
