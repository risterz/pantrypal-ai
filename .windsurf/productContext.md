# PantryPal AI Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

PantryPal was created to address several significant problems faced by home cooks:

1. **Food Waste Reduction**: According to research, the average household wastes approximately 30% of the food they purchase. PantryPal helps users utilize ingredients they already have, reducing waste and saving money.

2. **Recipe Discovery Challenges**: Finding recipes that match available ingredients often requires searching across multiple websites and platforms, creating a fragmented and time-consuming experience.

3. **Limited Cooking Knowledge**: Many home cooks lack the expertise to enhance recipes for better taste, nutrition, or dietary needs, leading to repetitive or unsatisfying meals.

4. **Personalization Needs**: Existing recipe platforms often fail to account for individual dietary preferences, restrictions, or taste preferences.

## Problems PantryPal Solves

1. **Ingredient-Based Recipe Search**: Users can input available ingredients and instantly find recipes that utilize what they have on hand.

2. **AI-Enhanced Cooking**: The DeepSeek AI integration provides intelligent suggestions to improve recipes, making them healthier, tastier, or adapted to specific dietary needs.

3. **Consolidated Recipe Experience**: PantryPal brings together recipe search, enhancement, and personalization in a single platform, eliminating the need to navigate multiple sites.

4. **Personalized Cooking Journey**: By learning user preferences and dietary needs, PantryPal creates a tailored cooking experience that improves over time.
