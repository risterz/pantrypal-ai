  "Use a meat thermometer to ensure proper cooking temperature.",
  "Brine your chicken in buttermilk overnight for extra tenderness and flavor.",
  "Pat chicken pieces dry before coating them for a crispier crust.",
  "Season your flour mixture generously for maximum flavor in every bite.",
  "Double-dip your chicken in buttermilk and flour for an extra-crispy coating.",
  "Let the coated chicken rest for 15-20 minutes before frying to help the coating adhere better.",
  
  // Cooking tips
  "Use a heavy-bottomed pan or cast iron skillet for even heat distribution.",
  "Maintain oil temperature between 325째F and 350째F for optimal frying results.",
  "Don't overcrowd the pan - fry in batches to maintain oil temperature.",
  "Turn chicken only once during frying to prevent coating from falling off.",
  "Allow fried chicken to drain on a wire rack instead of paper towels to keep it crispy.",
  "Add herbs like thyme or rosemary to your frying oil for subtle flavor infusion.",
  "Rest fried chicken for 5-10 minutes after cooking to allow juices to redistribute.",
  "For extra crunch, add a tablespoon of cornstarch to your flour mixture.",
  
  // Healthier options
  "Bake instead of fry for a healthier version with less oil.",
  "Remove chicken skin before coating to reduce fat content.",
  "Use whole wheat flour or a mixture of regular and whole wheat for added fiber.",
  "Try an air fryer for the crispy texture with significantly less oil.",
  "Substitute some of the flour with ground nuts for added nutrition and flavor.",
  
  // Flavor enhancements
  "Add a touch of hot sauce to your buttermilk marinade for a subtle kick.",
  "Include a tablespoon of honey in your marinade for a hint of sweetness.",
  "Mix in dried herbs like oregano and thyme to your flour mixture for depth of flavor.",
  "Add a pinch of cayenne pepper to your seasoning for gentle heat.",
  "Incorporate grated parmesan cheese into your coating for a savory twist.",
  "Finish with a light sprinkle of flaky sea salt right after frying for enhanced flavor."
