  categorized_enhancements JSONB,
  dietary_preferences JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ,

)
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Database connection not available"
- Check your `.env` file has the correct Supabase credentials

- Run the dependency installer again
- Try manual installation: `pip install supabase python-dotenv`
