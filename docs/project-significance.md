- **Personalize the cooking experience** by allowing users to save favorites, manage profiles, and receive tailored recommendations.

## Core Features
1. **Ingredient-Based Recipe Search:**
   - Users can input available ingredients and receive recipe suggestions that match their pantry.
   - Integration with external food recipe APIs (e.g., Spoonacular) to provide a wide variety of recipes.

2. **AI-Enhanced Cooking Suggestions:**
   - The application leverages AI to suggest healthier, faster, or tastier ways to prepare recipes.
   - Suggestions may include ingredient substitutions, alternative cooking methods, and flavor enhancements.

3. **Dietary Preference Filters:**

   - Authenticated users can save favorite recipes, add personal notes, and manage their profiles.

5. **User Authentication and Profile Management:**
   - Secure sign-up and login via email/password or third-party providers (Google, GitHub) using Supabase Auth.
   - Users can view and edit their profiles, manage saved recipes, and set dietary preferences.

6. **Feedback and Data Collection:**
   - Users can provide feedback on AI suggestions, helping to improve the recommendation engine.
   - The system tracks which enhancements are found useful and which recipes are saved or modified.

## Technical Scope
- **Frontend:** Built with React and Next.js, styled using Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI components for a modern, responsive interface.
- **Backend:** Utilizes Supabase for authentication, real-time database storage, and user management.
- **AI Integration:** Incorporates a lightweight AI model (e.g., TensorFlow.js) to generate cooking suggestions, with potential for future expansion.
- **API Integration:** Connects to external recipe APIs to fetch and cache recipe data.
- **Deployment:** Hosted on Vercel for seamless CI/CD and scalability.

## Out of Scope
- Native mobile applications (the current focus is web only).
- In-depth nutritional analysis beyond basic dietary filters.
- Direct grocery ordering or delivery services.
- Advanced social features (e.g., recipe sharing, community forums) beyond saving and personalizing recipes.

## Conclusion
PantryPal AI is positioned as a smart, user-centric platform that leverages AI to make home cooking more accessible, healthy, and enjoyable. By focusing on ingredient-based discovery, AI-powered enhancements, and personalized user experiences, the project aims to address common challenges in everyday cooking while remaining scalable and adaptable for future growth.

## Project Significance

One significant aspect of PantryPal AI is its potential to reduce food waste and promote sustainable cooking habits. By enabling users to search for recipes based on the ingredients they already have at home, the platform helps ensure that fewer ingredients go unused and are thrown away. This not only benefits individual households by saving money and maximizing grocery usage, but also contributes to broader environmental sustainability efforts by minimizing food waste on a larger scale.

Another key significance of the project lies in its ability to promote healthier eating and empower users to make better dietary choices. Through the integration of AI-driven suggestions, PantryPal AI provides users with practical recommendations for ingredient substitutions and alternative cooking methods that can lower calories, reduce unhealthy fats, and accommodate various dietary restrictions. This personalized approach to recipe enhancement supports users in achieving their health and wellness goals, regardless of their cooking expertise.

Finally, PantryPal AI stands out for its role in inspiring creativity and confidence in the kitchen. By offering innovative ways to enhance familiar recipes and providing tailored suggestions for flavor improvement, the platform encourages users to experiment and expand their culinary skills. The combination of expert-sourced and AI-generated enhancements ensures that users receive both reliable and inventive ideas, making home cooking a more enjoyable and rewarding experience for everyone.
